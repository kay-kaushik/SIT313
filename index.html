        <p class="p1">Support to international students is a website which was created by
             me during the lockdown of 2021 due to covid. The goverment did not provide any support to international students but there were charities
             which were providing food to international student in need. My website support to international students was a platform where charaties could
             connect with students in need. Github link: <a href="https://github.com/kay-kaushik/SIT223-JKJLD">Support to internationational students</a> <p>
